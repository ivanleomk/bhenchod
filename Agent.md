- look for a linear issue to tag your changes to
- Make sure you can find one, and if one doesn't exist, then just create one with a clear description of the problem and an acceptance criteria
- clarify the specific project that we're tagging this to , the scope that we should be working with and then write code. Don't just jump into things
